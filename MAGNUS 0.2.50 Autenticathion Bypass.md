# CVE-2024-41477: MAGNUS 0.2.50 Autenticathion Bypass
### Date: 10-07-2024
### Product: MAGNUS
### Version: 0.2.50 
### CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H

## Description
The vulnerability lies in how MAGNUS 0.2.50 handles login request responses. Specifically, an attacker can modify the login request response to bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the system.

## Attack vector
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must intercept and modify the response of the login request. This can be done using a proxy tool. The attacker first attempts to authenticate with incorrect credentials, which would normally result in a “401 Unauthorized” response. By changing this response to “200 OK”, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the system, bypassing the login authentication mechanism and accessing sensitive functions.

## Impact
The impact section provides a clear understanding of the consequences of the vulnerability:
- Unauthorized access: Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms intended to protect MAGNUS 0.2.50, gaining access without valid credentials.
- Privacy risks: Access to MAGNUS platform compromise sensitive personal or organizational data stored within the application.
- Potential system control: With unauthorized access, attackers may gain control over system functions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or disruptions.
- Service disruption: Exploitation could disrupt normal operations or availability of the affected service, impacting users and business operations.
